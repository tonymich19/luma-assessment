# Luma Health Automation Challenge

This repository contains the automation tests for the Luma Health website, completed as part of a challenge to evaluate skills in using **Cypress** for test automation and **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD integration.

---

## Objective

The goal of this project was to:
1. Automate key test scenarios for the Luma Health website.
2. Write clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.
3. Implement CI/CD to execute tests and generate detailed reports automatically.

## Test Scenarios

### Mandatory Test Cases
1. **Homepage Validation**  
   - Verify the homepage loads successfully.  
   - Ensure main elements (navigation bar, hero section, footer) are visible and functional.

2. **Navigation Links**  
   - Test that all main navigation links direct users to the correct pages.  
   - Ensure each page loads successfully and displays the expected content.


### Bonus Test Cases
1. **Responsive Design Check**  
   - Verify website layout adjusts appropriately for:
     - Mobile: 375x667  
     - Tablet: 768x1024  
     - Desktop: 1280x720  
   - Ensure key elements remain visible and usable across devices.

2. **404 Page**  
   - Verify navigating to a non-existent page returns a 404 error.  
   - Ensure the 404 page displays the expected messaging.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing framework.  
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for test scripts.  
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated test execution.  
- **Cypress Mochawesome Reporter**: Detailed test reporting.  
- **gh-pages**: For publishing test reports.  

---

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tonymich19/luma-assessment.git
   cd luma-assessment
   ```
2. Install Dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Configure environment variables (optional):

    - Specify viewport dimensions and other Cypress environment variables as needed.

---

## Execution Instructions

**Run Tests Locally**
Run tests with the following commands for different viewports:
```bash
    npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/tests/lumaAssessment.cy.js --browser chrome --env viewportWidth=375,viewportHeight=667
    npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/tests/lumaAssessment.cy.js --browser chrome --env viewportWidth=768,viewportHeight=1024
    npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/tests/lumaAssessment.cy.js --browser chrome --env viewportWidth=1280,viewportHeight=720
```

**View Reports Locally**
After running tests, reports will be available in the `cypress/reports` directory.

---

## Pipeline Setup
This project uses GitHub Actions to execute tests automatically on every `push` or `pull_request` to the main branch. The pipeline:

1. Runs tests for mobile, tablet, and desktop resolutions.
2. Uploads test reports as GitHub Action artifacts.
3. Publishes detailed test reports to the `gh-pages` branch.

---

## Test Reports

You can view detailed reports generated by the pipeline at the following links:

- **Desktop (1280x720)**: [View Report](https://tonymich19.github.io/luma-assessment/1280x720/index.html)
- **Tablet (768x1024)**: [View Report](https://tonymich19.github.io/luma-assessment/768x1024/index.html)
- **Mobile (375x667)**: [View Report](https://tonymich19.github.io/luma-assessment/375x667/index.html)

---

## Assumptions and Decisions

1. The `Contact Form` feature was not explicitly visible on the website, so tests related to it were skipped.
2. The `Navigation Links` test includes validations for elements on target pages, ensuring content loads correctly.
3. CI/CD ensures test execution consistency across resolutions and provides detailed feedback through reports.
